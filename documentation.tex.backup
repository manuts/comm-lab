\chapter{Introduction}

\section{GNU Radio}
GNU Radio is a free \& open-source software development toolkit
that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios.
It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware
to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment.
It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments 
to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.

A software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing 
in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware.
The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system,
the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different transmission standards;
thus, one software radio can used for a variety of applications.

GNU Radio performs all the signal processing.
You can use it to write applications to receive data out of digital streams 
or to push data into digital streams, which is then transmitted using hardware.
GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers,
demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other elements 
(in the GNU Radio jargon, we call these elements blocks) which are typically found in radio systems.
More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks 
and then manages how data is passed from one block to another.
Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.

Since GNU Radio is software, it can only handle digital data.
Usually, complex baseband samples are the input data type for receivers and the output data type for transmitters.
Analog hardware is then used to shift the signal to the desired centre frequency.
That requirement aside, any data type can be passed from one block to another 
- be it bits, bytes, vectors, bursts or more complex data types.

GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python programming language, 
while the supplied, performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++
using processor floating point extensions, where available.
GNU Radio Companion(GRC) is a Simulink-like graphical tool to design signal processing flow graphs.
GNU Radio supports several radio front-ends, either natively or through additional out-of-tree modules.
